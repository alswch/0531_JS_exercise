======= objects/arrays =======
Create an object that:
• holds data about you (firstName, lastName, birthday)
• contains an array property with a list of your interests
• contains a method that prints each array property to the console
• prints object to console with console.dir

======= functions/arguments =======
Create a function that:
• Receives 4 arguments: 2 numbers and 2 strings
• Prints the function name to the console
• Prints the received arguments to the console (one per line)
• Adds the numbers and saves result to a variable
• Outputs the result variable to the console
• Adds two string arguments and outputs the result to the console
• Uses the plus (+) symbol to add the number to the strings (works???)

======= conditionals =======
Write a conditional that:
• checks if a variable is less than 10
• If true, alert user (variable less than 10)
• If false, alert user (variable greater than 10)
• Try different values to test the conditional

Write a conditional to check if a string is the same as another string
• Test strings with uppercase/lowercase
• Test strings with preceding or following white spaces (e.g. "string",  "  string  ")

======= arrays =======
Create a function:
• with two arrays of different length (array1, array2)
• prints the first and last item from each array to the console
• has a multidimensional array (array3) that contains arrays 1 & 2
• prints each array3 element to the console
• prints the first and last items of array3 to the console
